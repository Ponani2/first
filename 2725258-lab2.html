        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p>
           I am a 3rd year student studying computer science at the University of the Witwatersrand. I enjoy watching watching volley ball and enjoy coding.’m particularly interested in web development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition to my studies, I am always excited about working on side projects that allow me to hone my skills in new technologies.
